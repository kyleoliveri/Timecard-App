## Time

- Time is an application designed for freelancers who need assistance with keeping track of their time.
- Time allows a user to create an account, add as many jobs (if applicable) as they would like, and begin logging their time.

## Responsibilities

- I was primarily responsible for front-end development. In the beginning stage of the project, I worked with the team to create wire-frames, a flow of how we want this application to work, as well as functionalities, features, etc.
