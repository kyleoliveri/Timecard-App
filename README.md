## Time

- Time is a React-based application designed for freelancers who need assistance with keeping track of their time.
- Time allows a user to create an account, add as many jobs (if applicable) as they would like, and begin logging their time.

## Responsibilities

- I was primarily responsible for front-end development alongside another team member. In the beginning stages of the project, I worked with the team to create wire-frames, a flow of how we want this application to work, as well as functionalities, features, etc. Once we had a general MVP, we began with the create-react-app boilerplate, and started working on building out components, connecting them to the back-end and bringing our wire-frames to life.
